        <h3 id="1">Can I buy points?</h3>
        <p>No you cannot buy points. We are not fans of micro-transactions ourselves and our service reflects that.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>I ordered/requested something and no one is bringing it to me.</h3>
        <p class="">Be patient. Not all requests are garunteed to be accepted by others. If you are requesting something unreasonable, it is unlikely to be fulfilled. Try ordering something smaller/easier, like a coffee or a book. If you think it's a technical bug, send us an email to <a href="mailto:hello@frrand.com">hello@frrand.com</a>.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Can anyone see my location? / Who can see my location?</h3>
        <p class="">No one can see your current location. We never show your current location to anyone.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>I have no points left. How do I get more?</h3>
        <p class="">To earn more points you must successfully complete a delivery for</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Can I pay for my order with my credit card?</h3>
        <p>Not at the moment. Currently, transactions can only take place in the form of cash. We are always looking to make doing favours as easy as possible and automatic payments is a high priority of ours.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>I had a problem with something brought to me. What do I do?</h3>
        <p>Please get in contact with us right away. Email us at <a href="mailto:hello@frrand.com">hello@frrand.com</a> and tell us what happened.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Can I see all of my past history on the app?</h3>
        <p>Yes. To see all of your request history: <em>Menu</em> > <em>My requests</em>
        <br><br>To see all of the deliveries you have done or committed to: <em>Menu</em> > <em>My to-dos</em> </p>
        <br>

        <h3>I love frrand! Can I use it forever?</h3>
        <p class="">Yes you can! We have plans to grow this into something much bigger than it is right now and hope you enjoy the ride.</p>
